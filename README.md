# Intrusion Data

The password is: **infected**

This repository was created to store the artifacts of any intrusions I share publicly. The main goal is to provide resources for newcomers in the field to help them develop their investigative skills with data from real intrusions. Each set of data is supported by a blog post that provides additional context. 

The blog post details the steps the threat actors took during the intrusion. Using this repository, individuals should be able to retrace these steps using the available telemetry for each case. During this process, they can gain knowledge about the different sets of tools and querying techniques.
